# PKMine

This is the repository for the EPAA designathon proposal PKMine. This proposal suggests the use of AI to extract PBPK parameters from literature (more specifically tables, could be extended to figures).

- resources contains links to possible tools of interest for the problem, as well as links to data available for training. It also contain an example of tables and the parameters that were extracted to frame the problem.
- workflows contains slides to conceptualize the proposed solution.
- demos contains notebooks with demos of tools that could be useful (empty as of 19-03-2024).
